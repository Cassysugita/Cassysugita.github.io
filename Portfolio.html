        <h1>Who Am I? </h1>
            <p>My name is Cassy Sugita, but sometimes people call me Cass, which feels kinda weird because usually only my close friends and family members do that, so don't do that unless we boiz. I like to think of myself as a pretty fun person to be around once I finally break out of my shell but until then I remain solitary. Mentally, I usually have good common sense and a great integrity which, together, keeps me out of trouble.  Physically, I'm like 5'2" and I wonder if I'll ever grow more or if I'll remain this height for the rest of my life. </p></td>

       <h1> Interests </h1>
         <p>One of my main hobbies is paddling. I don't paddle for my school but instead for a club called Kamaha'o Canoe Club, I usually sit in seat 1 or 2 and I've been paddling for 3 years. The club is very friendly and loving, it's easy to make friends and feel at home, but I think what I admire most about the enviroment there is the understanding that paddling is not just about winning but about the effort that goes in, the team work, and the journey it was to achieve victory. </p>

<p>Another thing I like to do is make playlists. They're nothing special, everyone makes playlists, but theres just something so satisfying about having a complaition of songs that all revolve around a central topic. A playlist can be a gift, a way to make connections with others, or just a fun way to share or listen to your favorite songs its so great. Chefs kiss. </p>
