            <p>was the first of it's kind. The order and the titles of the tracks walks you through the inevitable stages of youthful love. I made this playlist based on what I saw was happening everywhere around me, little did I know that I would later expirience it's exact contents myself. The person that this playlist is dedicated to taught me how to break out of my shell and showed me the world from a new perspective. The idea that I tried to get across is that love is not just said and done but instead a never ending cycle.</p>

The person this playlist was dedicated to had the same love for music that I did and that was something special when it csme to the costruction of this complation.  </p>

                <p>Sixteen was a birthday gift. It was the recievers 16th birthday and that is where this playlist got its title. Sixteen goes into the detail of a relationship, all the best parts and the occasional bad parts, as shown by track seven, Dead To Me. This was the only playlist that made it to a physical CD, the only copy ever made belongs to the person that this was dedicated to.</p>
